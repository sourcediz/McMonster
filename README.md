# McMonster
# What is this project?
Code challenge was to create a map based app. 
I have chosen to use google places api to grab local macdonalds close to the user and genrating a unique monster.
The plan was to make it so when visiting the macdonalds the user would do damage to the Mc Monster. These Mc Monster's are big boss creatures so multiple people 
throughout the week will have to take the battle to the Mc Monsters.

But I didn't get that far.
